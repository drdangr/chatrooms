-- Allow authenticated users to update embedding field for messages in accessible rooms
-- This is necessary because:
-- 1. LLM messages have sender_id = null, so "Users can update own messages" policy doesn't apply
-- 2. System messages also have sender_id = null
-- 3. Embedding updates are safe because they're generated server-side from message text

-- We need a policy that allows updating ONLY the embedding field for messages in accessible rooms
-- However, PostgREST doesn't support field-level RLS checks easily
-- So we'll allow updating messages if user has access to the room AND only embedding is being updated

-- Create a policy that allows embedding updates for any message in accessible rooms
-- Drop if exists first
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update embeddings in accessible rooms" ON public.messages;
